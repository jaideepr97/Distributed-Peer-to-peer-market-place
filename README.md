#How to run:

1) Clone the git repository: https://github.com/ds-umass/lab-1-rao-gupta.git
2) Navigate to the /test directory to find the test scripts.
3) Each test script can be executed by running ./test1.sh for example. This would compile and run the entire program for the given test.
4) The program is set to run for a period of 2 minutes, after each all the generated processes are automatically terminated, after which a set of output files should be generated within the same directory. Depending on the test that is executed, a different number of output files will be generated (one for each node in the topology that was executed)
5) The output files show the sequence of events that occurred with respect to a particular node and also include the time-based performance metrics for each node
